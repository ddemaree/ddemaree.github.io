# About this site

This document was lovingly handcrafted in Coda iOS (with a bit of editing in Coda for Mac). It's written in pure HTML5 and CSS; no preprocessors or flat-file CMSes were employed in its making.

Body text is set in [Freight Text][ft] from Darden Studio; title and H1s are set in [AW Conqueror Carved One], subtitle, H2s, and social links set in [AW Conqueror Sans], from Typofonderie. All web fonts served via Typekit.

Many thanks to Chris Coyier and CSS Tricks, for showing me how to use SVG symbols and flexbox.

Much gratitude to [Matt Haughey's definitive post on OpenGraph/Twitter Card meta tags](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254#.sfy2v7clf)

<p>I'm a programmer, web designer, and businessperson, currently serving as senior product manager for <a href="https://typekit.com">Adobe Typekit</a>, where I help lead user experience design and business strategy alongside <a href="https://typekit.com/about">a crackerjack team of done-getters</a>.</p> <p>Before joining Adobe, I worked on a small team building a local listings product for Metromix, a joint venture of Gannett &amp; Tribune, and before that I ran a small agency that designed and developed Ruby on Rails apps for clients including DirecTV, Viacom, ABC, and T-26.</p>

<p>In 2016, A Book Apart published my first book, <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/git-for-humans"><cite>Git for Humans</cite></a>, a simple guide to Git and version control basics that aims to demystify what's really going on when you type Git commands. You can get the book <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/git-for-humans">directly from A Book Apart</a>, or from <a href="https://itun.es/us/QC5vab.l">iBooks</a>. You can read an excerpt from the book, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-art-of-the-commit">"The Art of the Commit"</a>, on A List Apart.</p>

<p>I live and work in the suburbs of New York City with my wife Jody Weinmann, and our daughter June, who is a lion.</p>
